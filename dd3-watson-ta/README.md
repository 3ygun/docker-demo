# Watson TA Demo

Dockered [Watson TA App](https://github.com/signofthehorns/watson-ta)

# Lessons

- Structuring your `Dockerfile` to increase caching
    - JavaScript packages more likely to change than Python
- Grow to meet your needs
    - We added the aliases last to make a smoother install
- Mix in some of the familiar!
    - The `CMD` command never seems to do what I want :(
